# Task Management Console Application

A simple, console-based task management system written in Java. This application allows users to create, delete, update, and filter tasks based on various properties. The project demonstrates core Java mastery, including Object-Oriented Programming principles, exception handling, Java annotations, Java Collections, and the use of Java Streams API.



### Object-Oriented Programming Principles: 
Utilized OOP fundamentals such as encapsulation, abstraction, and the SOLID principles to design a modular task management system.
Generics and Java Collections Framework: Employed collections such as List and Java Generics to store and manage tasks effectively.

### Java Annotations:
Created custom annotations like @ImportantTask and @OverdueTask to categorize tasks and enhance code readability.
Exception Handling: Defined custom exceptions (e.g., InvalidTaskException) to manage errors gracefully and provide clear user feedback.

### Java Streams API: 
Used Java Streams for efficient task filtering, searching, and transformation operations.

### Java Enum Types: 
Leveraged enums for task status (TaskStatus) and priority (TaskPriority) to enforce specific task states and priorities.
Lambda Expressions and Functional Interfaces: Used lambdas to implement functional programming concepts, making the code more concise and expressive.
